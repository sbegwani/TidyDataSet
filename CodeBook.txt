This data set consists of 10299 observations of 68 variables.

The first 66 variables are based on feature variables in the features vector provided.
    -  There are 66 feature variables in the features vector which have "mean()" or "std()" in their variable name.
    -  The first 66 variables in this data set are based on these 66 feature variables
    -  The variable names in this data set are more descriptive than those in the features vector
    -  These variables assume double-precision real number values


The 67th variable is the number of the subject and ranges from 1 to 30. It is stored in a character format.
The 68th variable is the activity type. This is a character variable and takes one of 6 values: 
     {"Walking","Walking Upstairs","Walking Downstairs","Sitting","Standing","Lying"}

The first 66 variables in this data set are the average/mean of the values of the corresponding feature variables
    -  The feature variables have been grouped first by activity and then by subject number for the purpose of computing summary values
    -  The summarized data is sorted by activity (ascending order) and then by subject (ascending order, i.e. 1,2,3.. 30)


The entire processing logic is described in detail in the README.md file. 
The run_analysis.R file containing the code is also elaborately commented.

Provided below are the names of the 68 variables, the feature variable they are based on (for all but the last two variables), and the class of the variable.
